# Description of the code and its functions 

# (Please open the .py file to access the code)

This programme is capable of carrying out four functions with regards to the text file “WorldPopulationData2019.txt”. 

When the user first runs the code, they will be introduced to a menu, that provides them with the option of selecting one of the functions. The user can do so by clicking on the respective box that carries out the function they wish to carry out. (The name of the functions have been specified below each box). 

The functions provided in this programme are as follows:
1)	Lists out the total population of different continents, and plots the respective pie chart. 
2)	Lists the country name, 2019 population, and population change of all the countries in the order of descending population change. The function then prompts the user for a value “n” and draws a bar chart for the negative population change of n countries. Note: the maximum value that can be inputted by the user is 8
3)	Prompts user input for a number “n”, and prints the top n countries with the largest population change in 2019 
4)	Lists the countries with the smallest and largest populations for each continent


# FUNCTION 1: Lists out the total population of different continents, and plots the respective pie chart:

-	In order to access the first function, the user has to click the first box of the menu, titled “2019 Population by continent”.
-	Refer to the Python Shell to obtain the 2019 Population data by continent. 
-	Turtle will then proceed to draw a pie chart, indicating the proportion of each continent’s population as compared to the total population. 
-	The “back” button will appear on the top left side of the screen. In order to access the menu to carry out another function, the user will need to click the “back” button once. 


# FUNCTION 2: Percentage change of population of all countries in descending order and bar chart:

-	In order to execute this function, the user has to be the second box of the menu, titled “ Percentage change in Population” 
-	On Python Shell, The function will print out the list of countries with a descending population change percentage. 
-	After this has been done, the function will prompt the user for a number with a maximum value of 8. For the number entered by the user, the function will plot a bar graph for the top n countries with a negative population in descending order. 
-	The “back” button will appear on the top left side of the screen. In order to access the menu to carry out another function, the user will need to click the “back” button once. 


 
# FUNCTION 3: Top n countries with greatest population change

In order to execute this function, the user has to be the third box of the menu, titled “ Increase in population in 2019”.  

The function will prompt the user for a number, and will print out the list of the top n countries with the greatest change in population in 2019 on Python Shell. 

The menu will be re-drawn and the user can click on the next function that they wish to execute.



# FUNCTION 4: Countries with the Maximum and Minimum Population in each continent

In order to execute this function, the user has to be the fourth box of the menu, titled “ Maximum and Minimum Population Data by Continent”.  

On Python shell, the maximum and minimum population data by continent will appear. 

The menu will be re-drawn and the user can click on the next function that they wish to execute.
